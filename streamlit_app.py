In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1,2,3]})
df  # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw the dataframe

x = 10
'x', x  # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw the string 'x' and then the value of x

# Also works with most supported chart types
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

arr = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=100)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(arr, bins=20)

fig  # ðŸ‘ˆ Draw a Matplotlib chart
